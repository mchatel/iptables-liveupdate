Appearance rules for Python source files
----------------------------------------

- Each file passes the "Inspect Code..." of editor PyCharm
  with no warnings or errors except for unknown names that
  can be added to PyCharm's dictionary.

- Conform to several suggested rules in PEP 8 Python Style Guide:

      Maximum line length is 79 characters. In some cases,
      this influences the coding of the more complex
      string concatenation operations.

      No spaces at the end of lines (not detected by PyCharm).

      No backslashes used for line continuation.

      All string quotes use the double-quote character,
      the single-quote is used sparingly within strings and comments.

- Proper docstrings for all functions.

- Uses module "argparse" for command-line argument processing.

- Uses module "logging" for output messages.

- No usage of the print statement.
